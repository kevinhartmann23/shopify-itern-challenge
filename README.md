- run `npm install`
- open `index.html`

If you would like to make contributions, please fork the repo first.

### Challenges & Wins
#### Wins
- **Timing**: Given the amount of time and the workload I currently have with school, I am proud of what I accomplished. BUT not taking any excuses and giving this a try was a huge wine.

#### Challenges
- **Timing**: This past week, has been my final project and final assessment for school. Taking this code challenge on was a bit of an overload. Having more time that a few days to work on this would have generated a much better product.
- **Git Workflow & Organization**: With the time constraint my organization fell short. 

### Future Iterations
- Implement TDD
- Clean Up Responsiveness and Accesibility
- Build a login page

### Task 
**The Shoppies: Movie awards for entrepreneurs**
Shopify has branched out into movie award shows and we need your help. Please build us an app to help manage our movie nominations for the upcoming Shoppies.

### Challenge 

We need a webpage that can search [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/) for movies, and allow the user to save their favourite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.

We'd like a simple to use interface that makes it easy to:
- Search OMDB and display the results (movies only)
- Add a movie from the search results to our nomination list
- View the list of films already nominated
- Remove a nominee from the nomination list

### Technical Requirments
1. Search results should come from OMDB's API (free API key: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).
2. Each search result should list at least its title, year of release and a button to nominate that film.
3. Updates to the search terms should update the result list
4. Movies in search results can be added and removed from the nomination list.
5. If a search result has already been nominated, disable its nominate button.
6. Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations
